Online Leaning
*************
performance increased based on your usuability.
Dynamically Train model on server.
we train our model on mini batch (small chunks of data ) of data and train squentially incremently.

DATA --> MODEL ---> TEST ---> SERVER  <--- data --data --data
                                |
                                |
                                v
                           (predict and learn)
         
         
 Example : swift key keyboard,youtube,alexa 
 
 When to you online learning?
 when there is concept drift means when your promble  is changing volantryly ,example stock market ,ecommerce
 when you want to save money
 
 
 How to implement?
 Using Python

        Offline Learning
        
        
  Disadvantage:
  
 Tricky to use  it new technology ,no assurace , unstable

  Risky : Model depend to incomming data , chances of being biased.
  
  
  Solution:
  
  Anomaly detection
