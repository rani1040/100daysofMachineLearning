EDA stands for explanatory Data Analysis ,it is an approch to analyze the data using visual techniques. 
it is used to discover trends , patterns or to check assumptions with the help of statistical summary and graphical representation.

The four types of EDA are univariate non-graphical, multivariate non- graphical, univariate graphical, and multivariate graphical.

1. Univariate Analysis  works by examining the effects of a singular variable on a set of data, it simply takes data and provides a summary and associated patterns.
   Tables, charts, polygons, and histograms are all popular methods for displaying univariate analysis of a specific variable (e.g. mean, median, mode, standard variation, range, etc). 

    There are two type of Data:
    1. Numeric
    2. Categorial

First question we start with is What is the nature of Columns data and what is our output feature ?
---is it Numeric and Categori data.

1.Categorial Data

    which column is telling about our output column?
    calculate its frquency count with
          count plot 
          sns.countplot(df['survied])
          df['survied'].value_count().plot('kind=bar)
          mean_fair_price
          -->pie char 
          autopct=*.2f   // percentage

                      Seaborn and matplotlib padhle behn please 

2. Numerical data
     if data is continous then calculate max,mean 

      a. Histogram create range -- bins-- to see distribution
          plt.hist(df['age'],bins=50)

      b. Distplot
          sns.distplot(df['age'])  #kernel density distribution probability  density function

      c. Bloxplot :gives 5 number summary
          sns.boxplot(df['fare])
              median 
              q1--25th percentile ,q3=75 percentile
              minimum=q1-1.5*iqr
              iqr=inter quatile range (q3-q1)
               outlieer
               
      d.  minimum and maximum value
           skew()
