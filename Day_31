BOX COX Transform : The Exponent here is a variable called lambda that ovieries over the range -5 to 5, and in the process of 
searching , we examine all value of lambda . finally we choode the optimal value(resulting in the best 
approximation to a normal distribution for your variable.
             
Formula              
                        {  
                           (Xi^(lambda)-1)/lambda     if lambda !=0
   Xi ^ (lambda) =          In(Xi)                    if lambda =0
                         }
                         
  Two techniques to calculate this is Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Statistics.
  
  
 RESTRICTION                      
    not valid for negative and zero
    number should greater than zero
    
    
 YEO- JOHNSON : This transformation is somewhat of an adjustment to the Box=Cox transformation , by which we can apply it to the negative number.

                     (Xi+1)power(lambda)-1)/lambda           if lambda !=0 and Xi>=0

 Xi(lambda)=         -[(-Xi+1)^2-lambda -1)/(2-lambda)]      if lambda !=2 and Xi<0
