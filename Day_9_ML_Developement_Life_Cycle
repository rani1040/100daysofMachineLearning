Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) : is a process used by the software industry to design, develop and test high quality softwares.
The SDLC aims to produce a high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates.

Steps :

1. Framming the Problem

2. Gathering Data

3. Data Preprocessing -- remove duplicates, outliers, scalling, standorized

4. Exploratory Data Analysis :univariant analysis, bivarriant analysis,imbaalance--balance,visualize

5. Feature Enginerring and Selection: changing columns

6: Model Training Evaluation and Selection : performance metrix -- how good our model is, hyperparameter learning ,esemeble learning

7: Model Deployement : create application -- Binary file (pickle) ---> API(url gives-->json data file)  ---> User ---> Input ---> Python
                                                   |
                                                   V
                                                Server
                                                
8: Testing : A/B testing 

9.Optimize : backup, data backup, automation setup, load  balancing, frequently retrain, roooting-perform decline



Following are the most important and popular SDLC models :)

1. Waterfall Model

2. Iterative Model

3. Spiral Model

4. V-Model

5. Big Bang Model
