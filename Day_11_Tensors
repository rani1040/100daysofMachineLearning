What is tensor object?

:) Tensors are simply mathematical objects that can be used to describe physical properties,
just like scalars and vectors. In fact tensors are merely a generalisation of scalars and vectors
a scalar is a zero rank tensor, and a vector is a first rank tensor.

RANK 
The rank (or order) of a tensor is defined by the number of directions
(and hence the dimensionality of the array) required to describe it.

e.g

electrical conductivity is a second rank tensor and can be specified by 9 independent coefficients,
which can be represented in a 3×3 matrix.
j1 = σ11E1 + σ12E2 + σ13E3


Other examples of second rank tensors include electric susceptibility, thermal conductivity, stress and strain.
They typically relate a vector to another vector, or another second rank tensor to a scalar.
Tensors of higher rank are required to fully describe properties that relate two second rank tensors
(e.g. Stiffness (4th rank): stress and strain) or a second rank tensor and a vector (e.g. Piezoelectricity (3rd rank): stress and polarisation).

:) Libraries(Skit Learn )using tensor as data structure.
:) it is a container for number .
:) matrix and vector are known as tensor.
:) general term for n dimensional.



Scalers(1,2,3,4,5,6) ares 0D tension -they have zero dimensionhttps
