To understand data better we need to ask some basic first :

Ques : What are the basics question that  you should ask when you get data?


1. How big the dayta is ?
--> df.shape

2. How does that data look like?
 --> df.head()
     df.sample(5) -- give random row 


3. what is data type of cols?
 --> df.info() #help in optimization


4. Are there any missing values?
--> watch out missing value
    df.isnull.sum() -gives the number of missing values

5. How does the data look mathemetically?
--> df.describe() -- only for numeric columns

6. Are there duplicate values?
-->df.duplicated().sum()
    df.drop_duplicated()

7. How is the correlation between cols?
--> which   columns are independent ,means not related to our output so that we can easily drop that column.
   df.corr()['survied']  values between -1 and 1
