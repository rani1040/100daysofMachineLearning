Challenges in Machine Learning


1.Data Collection --  web scrapping or from api

2.Insufficient Data -- not labeled data

3.Non Rpresentative Data/Poor Representation of data -- cause sampling noise --> due to biasness samping bias --> still not representing

4. Poor Quality of Data -- Very impt

5.Irrelevant Features --Garbage in Garbage out

6.Overfitting

7.Underfitting

8.Software Integration

9.Offline Learning and Delopyment

10.Cost Involved
