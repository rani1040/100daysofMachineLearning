1. What is Outlier ?

:) Outliers are the values that look different from the other values in the data.
-- data points which differe from other data points.

Reasons for outliers in data ?
  * Errors during data entry or a faulty measuring device (a faulty sensor may result in extreme readings).
  * Natural occurrence (salaries of junior level employees vs C-level employees)

data of student number of hours study and marks obtain,their is linear trend , some outlier study less and get more marks .
they are hidden.



Problems caused by outliers ?
    * Outliers in the data may causes problems during model fitting (esp. linear models).
    * Outliers may inflate the error metrics which give higher weights to large errors (example, mean squared error, RMSE).

2. When outlier is dangeorous ?
age data -- someone age is 300 that  means this is wrong it is not possible..

3. When to Keep Ouliers ?
Situations like anamoly detection algorithm.
when outliers are getting justified 
for example in above example we can create a new column iq then it will justify the outlier.

Effects of Outliers On ML Algorithm ?
Performance reduce in : Weight based algorithm.
Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
Ada boost 
Deep Learning

Less effect of outlier on : tree based algorithm
Random Forest 
Decision tree
gradient boosting


3. How to treate Outlier ?

1. Trimming : remove outlier 
  * fast 
  * data gets thin
  
2. Capping : put limit, example number less than 1 gives it 1 and number greater than 90 makes all 90.

3. treate outlier as missing value

4. Discritization -- numerical data into brackers 
example 0-10,10-20,30-40,40-50
we treat greater than 50 as 50


4. How to detect Outlier ?

if your data (column)mis normally distributed then 
      - 1 std and 1 std =68.2 % observation
      -2 std and 2 std = 95.4%
      -3 std and 3 std = 99.7% observation

      if particular observation is outside range of 
      (mean-3*std ,mean*3std) we treat it like an outlier .
      
 if data is skewed :
     IQR Proximity rule 
     plot boxplot and data should be in range of min and max
     minimum value = Q1-1.5*1QR 
     maximum value =Q3+1.5*IQR
     
  3. Percentile Based approch :for  other distribution 
  
    if observation is outside 97 or 99 percentile then outlier.

    if observation is outside 5 percentile then outlier
