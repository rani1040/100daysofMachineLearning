Feature Engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features from raw data. 
These features can be used to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms.


-Feature Engineering

  1. Feature Transformation -- changing into form which has good perfromance .
  
     1. Missing Values Imputation -- remove or fill that missing values (mean,median) 
     
     2. Handling Categorial Value -- converting one form into anothore (e.g String to numeric).
     
     3. Outlier Detection -- Principle
     
     4. Feature Scaling  -- 
     
  2. Feature Construction --create a complete new columns ,based on intution
  
  
  3. Feature Selection -- we have many input columns but we are selecting some inputs (extracting importance feature )
     
     MNIST dataset - 28*28 resolution -784 pixel 
    
  4. Feature Extraction -- from given feature creating new feature -pca 
    example room, washroom, price remove one column-- sqft area,price
