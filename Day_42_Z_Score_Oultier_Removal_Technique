1. Z_score Assumptions :) it should be normally distributed (bell curve) or close to normall curve .
we can assume betqeen the range of :
  mean to 1 std deviation there are 68.2% observation .
  (-2std  2std)=95.4%
  (-3std  3std) =99.7%

if any value is outside this range then treat it as outlier 

Z score:
           Xi-mean
  X`    =  -------
             std
             
2.how to treat this outlier :)

  * Trimming : remove rows with outliers .significant amount of data is being remove when their is high outliers.
              approch 1: remove columns with highest and lowest
              approch 2: zscore 
  * Capping : Cap outliers . means values less then minimum make it minimum and greater than naximum make it maximum.
