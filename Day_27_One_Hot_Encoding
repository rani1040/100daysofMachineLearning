One Hot Encoding
1. create one column for each category.

  Color    |   color_y |color_b  |color_r
  yellow   |     1     |  0      | 0
  blue     |     0     |  1      | 0
  red      |     0     |  0      | 1
  
Multicollinearity : input columns cannot have maths relnship , is there mathemetical relationship if they have ,then remove this
if there are n category then we will be creating n-1 columns ,otherwise there will be dummy Variable trap.
 
Dummy Variables are the columns which we have  genereted color_y,color_b and color_r.
and due to generation of this dummy variable there will be problem of multicollinearity as sum of all three column of eeach color is 1 .
hence we will drop columns 1.


OHE using most frequent Variables

if nominal categorial data has more category then for each category there will be one column for each.
then this will create lots of columns which will increases the dimensionality of our data and slow data preprocessing.

other than most frequent category we will be transfering into one other category .


Steps :
value_counts()
try own 
inbuilt -- .get_dummy(df.columns['fuel','owner'])
predict own columns
drop_first(True)

Pandas get_dummies doesnt remeber about the columns , it gives different column sequence every single time you run thats why we generally avid this in machine learning projects.

1. train test split
