What happen when we apply function transformer ?
    our probability density function turns into norma distribution function .
    around which calculations gets easy and many algorithms like linear and logistic regression want this
    type of distribution .
  
Function Transformer : 
    * log 
    * reciprocal
    * square and square root 
    * custom transformer 


How to find if data is normal ?
1. seaborn displot 
2. pandas skiwed() function

3. QQ plot : more the points on 45 degree line it is normally distributed :

      1. Data too peaked in middle --->  Line deviate  
      2. Skewed Data --> away from line data points
      3. Skewed Left --> away from line at bottom
      4. Skewed Right --> away from line from top 
      5. Fat tails --> away from both top and bottom
      6. Thin Tail --> close to line
      
 1. LOG TRANSFORM -- it will make data normally distribute 
       convert additive scale to muttiplicative scale .
       Linearly distributed.
       not work -ve value.
       it will bring right skewed data into middle.
       log make data into equal scale
 take log of all value 
 
 
 2. Reciprocal  Transform 1/x
      samll value --> large 

      value
      znd vice versa
 
 3. Square root Transform :
